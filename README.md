MetaNeighbor: a method to rapidly assess cell type identity using both functional and random gene sets
================
MetaNeighbor allows users to quantify cell type replicability across datasets using neighbor voting.

Please refer to its [online](./Documentation.md) or [pdf](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/MetaNeighbor/inst/doc/MetaNeighbor.pdf) documentation and consider citing [Crow et al (2018) Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03282-0) if you find MetaNeighbor useful in your research.
